          <span>EGG is a cloud storage program that establishes a space for actualizing creative content as well as sharing said content. </span>
          <span>Role: Creator and Lead designer.
            Deliverables: Sketches, wireframes, branding, mockups, and final product.
            Tools used: Draw.io, Figma</span>

          <span>About the Project. SKETCHING: Initial ideas.</span>
          <span>Smoothly creating, sharing, and storing digital content has become synonymous with finding the holy grail.
            Though there are several existing programs that specialize or succeed in one or two of those aspects, EGG fulfills a vacuum in cloud and social storage for young people to express themselves in an integrative, comprehensive way. </span>

          <span>Project challenges. BRANDING: Logo drafts.</span>
          <span>As the Designer of this project, I wanted to create a system that broke away from the either/or hitch that is common and expected in this category-- either you will be able to create spreadsheets and documents on this platform or you will only be able to ‘pin’ tiles onto your storyboard.
            It was important that EGG didn’t blend into the mix of a typical cloud storage program. As an initiative that champions and celebrates a full spectrum of life, I wanted EGG to stand out as a unique, holistic offering.
            Another aspect I had to keep in mind during this phase was how this system would work with a variety of users. I knew we needed to have an expansive social setting, multiple options of creation, and a UI that would encourage use on a daily basis.</span>

          <span>Project solutions. CONTENT STRATEGY: Sitemap.</span>
          <span>The project began with multiple approaches to user research- competitive analyses, user surveys & personas, and user stories.
            Those stories were the backbones to creating this sitemap that paved the path for EGG wireframes and continued iterations.</span>

        <li>
          <span>Project solutions. WIREFRAMING.</span>
          <span>At my first round of usability tests, I created a skeleton platform to test for ease and level of novelty-- I made sure my users understood how to use the program, as well as was keen on a heavier social media presence and the additional avenues for content creation.
            In my second round I incorporated branding. These additions - the playful logo with a complmenetary, modern colour palette - fleshed out the primary look and feel. In this round I confirmed the branding enhanced the product.
            Lastly I tested three additional UI options and confirmed that the current look and feel highlighted the app’s whimsical nature as well as continued ease of the program. </span>

          <span>Project solutions. PREVIEW OF FINAL PRODUCT.</span>
          <span>As EGG has not formally launched, I cannot make continued changes as use issues arise. However, to ensure an overall visual language that reflectsed both the brand and the content, I polled several seasoned designers to articulate the tone of the product.
            I’ve learned through my iterations, including my final product; how to construct clear messaging, how to keep a simplicity without undermining the product, and how to apply subtle colour theory to keep eyes occupied and focused on the app.
            Furthermore, in creating EGG, I learned that there is always space for two philosophies- more convenient, and more innovative, ideas. As long as the proper execution follows, users are, more often than not, very willing to explore and adapt! </span>
